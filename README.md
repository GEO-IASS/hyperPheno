Hyperspectral Phenology

This R pacakge is designed to extract hyperspectral data from the SOC 710 hyperspectral camera.
The camera has been collected phenology data from the Harvard Barn site between April, 2013 to January, 2016.
This code should work alongside with the imageRun shiny app to extract ROI and create mask as the camera field of view has changed a few times or the reference panel was relocated.

The code is developed and maintained by [Bijan Seyednarollah](https://github.com/bnasr) since November, 2017.
